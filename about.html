                        <p>At first I was skeptical and I didn’t think they would be able to help get my credit in better shape. After the first month a repossession I had for over 5 years was deleted. I’ve paid other companies monthly and got no results. Whatever they do it works and i’m forever grateful.Eliminate bad credit and create opportunities for growth within your business</p>

                        <p>Working with Cam the owner was an amazing opportunity. He’s what I call an “hidden gem creative”. He has the ability to think quickly on his toes and provide a solution to our problems and help us cut cost, making my business all the more effective. He’s always been available to answer questions and even when he wasn’t his staff got back to us promptly.</p>

                        <p>The Normac Group helped me build credit and I was able to get my first car with an amazing interest rate and payment. Mr. Cam went above and beyond to even help me negotiate my deal with the salesperson. I don’t know of any other company that would have even taken the time to do that. He made sure he explained everything to me and showed me how to make my credit work for me.</p>

                        <p>I personally am a credit specialist, however my schedule has been extremely busy. I thought I’d give This company a try and when I got the results far above what I expected. I realized I needed to work on more things on my end and figure out exactly how their so good at what they do. I’ve never had a issue with communication from Mr. Cam or his agents and he’s always prompt when he tells you he will call you back or email you. Currently, I send some of my tougher clients to his company because he’s passionate about the work he doesn’t and they treat everyone with the upmost respect.</p>
